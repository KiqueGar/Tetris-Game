# Tetris-Game
A tetris game written in python

## Setting up

A conda environment is created, you can clone it by using
`conda `

## Known bugs
- Can't reproduce: bad assignment to zone color, thus bad color in outliers
- Can possibly assign 2 zones the same color
- Not refreshing outliers position after deleting row, thus misscalculating correct lines

## Future implementations
- Game don't closes at Game Over
- Blocks generate at random positions
